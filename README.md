# leaflet-challenge


This project's goal was to visualize earthquake data geospatially using data from USGS. 

Utilizing JavaScript, Leaflet, and the Mapbox API, an interavtive map was created to display the data in a visually appealing and informative manner.

Each point on the map scaled according to magnitude, and the color represents the depth of the earthquake. Multiple map stlyes can be chosen, as well as the option to show tectonic
plate data along side the earthquake data. 

The project can be seen in action here:  https://mdaxc6.github.io/leaflet-challenge/
